\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Had Walter Alvarez not asked his father, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez, how long the clay had taken to deposit, the younger Alvarez may not have thought to use iridium, an element rarely found on earth but more plentiful in meteorites, to answer this question. Iridium, in the form of microscopic grains of cosmic dust, is constantly raining down on the planet. The Alvarezes reasoned that if the clay layer had taken a significant amount of time to deposit, it would contain detectable levels of iridium.\'a0 The results were startling \'96 far too much iridium had shown up. The Alvarez hypothesis, as it became known, was that everything \'96 not just the clay layer, could be explained by a single event: a six-mile-wide asteroid had slammed into Earth\'97killing off not only the forams but the dinosaurs, and all the other organisms that went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period.}
